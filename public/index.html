              I created a website to help people practice for the
              <strong>amateur radio exams</strong>. The website allows you to

              The FCC provides a pool of questions that are to be used on the
              exams. I wrote some python scripts to convert the question pool
              data, which is provided in text and PDF formats, into JSON. I then
              used the headless CMS <strong>Contentful</strong> to host the
              question data. The client side of the website is hosted on
              <strong>Netlify</strong>.

              The project was created with <strong>React</strong> and is still a
              work in progress but is currently functional. It allows a user to
              take an exam and then see their results at the end.
